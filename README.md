# Huge-Integer-Big-Integer-Class-Immplemetation
Complete Implementation of Huge Integer/Big Integer in a Class with Operators Overloading.
- Main Attributes of Class:
```
class HugeInt{
int* Ds;
int size;
bool isNeg;
};
```
- 5 Constructors for Different intialization of HugeInt Objects.
- Overloaded Operators for **cin** & **cout**.
- Overloaded Operators for all types of Calculations like + , - , * , / , += , -=, *= , /= , != , > , < , >= , <=, ++ , -- , etc.
- Destructor for cleaning memory.
- All type of Private ultility functions for numbers calculation. <br />
## Main Features
- Can handle number of any length (much higher than a normal integer length like 100s or 1000s of digits and more)
- With 5 constructors, any type of implementation is possible like from string, txt files, etc.
- Operations like Multiplications, Division and Power are implemented with most efficient algorithms for faster calculations even on bigger number. These Algorithms performs sagnificantly higher (much faster in calculations) as compare to brute force or naive approaches means that their space complexity and time complexity is sagnificantly less.
- Getting a single digit from the whole number is O(1) operation because in backend it is using **Dynamic Array of Integers**.<br />
